# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ This is my take on Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, built just for fun (and to show off a bit) using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Outline

- **Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe**: Itâ€™s tic-tac-toe, but on 9 boards at once. Win small boards to win the big one!
- **Play vs Friend or AI**: Challenge a buddy or try to outsmart the computer.
- **Smooth Animations**: The UI pops with GSAP-powered transitions and confetti when you win. Feels good!
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works great on your phone or desktop.
- **Quick Tutorial & Restart**: Lost? Thereâ€™s a built-in tutorial and a restart button if you want a rematch.

## Tech Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **GSAP** for animations
